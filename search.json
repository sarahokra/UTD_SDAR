Unlike the Cartesian product, which combines every tuple from the first relation with every tuple from the second relation without any condition, natural join selects only those tuples where the values match on the common attributes present in both relations.\nTherefore, in this case, natural join may incorrectly match dept_name in instructor and course table:\nBoth instructor and course tables contain the dept_name attribute. However, dept_name in the instructor table represents the department to which the instructor belongs, whereas in the course table, it represents the department offering the course. Since natural join enforces equality on all common attributes, this leads to the following issue: If the instructor’s department (instructor.dept_name) does not match the department offering the course (ourse.dept_name), the corresponding record will not appear in the result. This incorrectly excludes courses that are cross-listed across departments, leading to incomplete query results.\nTo avoid natural join from treating all matching attributes as join conditions, SQL provides a form of inner join that allows us to specify explicit join conditions, as shown below:\n\nselect name, title\nfrom (instructor join teaches using (ID)) \njoin section using (course_id, sec_id)\njoin course using (course_id)\nwhere section.semester = 'Spring' and section.year = 2017;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\nname\ntitle\n\n\n\n\nBrandt\nGame Design\n\n\nBrandt\nGame Design\n\n\nKim\nIntro. to Digital Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n(The above content refers to P.126-P.131 of the textbook, SKS.)",

Be ready for your presentation.\n\n1. Name and describe three applications you have used that employed a database system to store and access persistent data. (e.g. airlines, online trade, banking, university system)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications\nPurpose\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nOnline Shopping Platform (e.g., Amazon)\nStores user account information, product details, order history, logistics data, and user behavior.\nSupports concurrent access for multiple users and maintains query efficiency.\n\n\nBanking System (e.g., Bank of America Mobile App)\nManages account balances, transaction histories, loans, and other financial product information.\nEnsures data consistency and security while preventing data loss and errors.\n\n\nUniversity Course Management System (e.g., UTD Course Registration System)\nStores course information (e.g., course ID, credit hours, schedule, instructor, etc.), tracks registered students, calculates total earned credits, and determines tuition fees.\nSupports concurrent access for multiple users and enables real-time information updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Propose three applications in domain projects (e.g. criminology, economics, brain science, etc.) Be sure you include:\n\nPurpose\nFunctions\nSimple interface design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain\nPurpose\nFunctions\nInterface Design\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare\nControl of acute infectious diseases – Supply users with immediate prevention information during pandemics.\n\nDisplay current policies, infection, and death counts.\nBrowse locations visited by infected individuals.\nProvide testing reservations.\n\n\nEssential info display area for policies and counts.\nSearch bar and infection map.\nTesting facility search field.\n\n\n\nEducation\nLearning portfolio management – Enable students to store learning data, assess their chances of admission, and support them in the university application process reviews.\n\nDisplay and edit student information.\nRecord and query course history.\nAnalyze student performance and estimate admission chances.\n(Students) Upload documents (e.g., transcripts, awards). / (Teachers) Verify the authenticity of student submissions.\nPackage and automatically send data to schools.\n\n\nStudent info display area.\nCourse record display area and search field.\nPerformance radar chart and school. recommendations list.\nUpload fields for transcripts, awards, and reflections / Verification fields for student documents.\nData packaging and send button.\n\n\n\nTourism\nTravel planning – Store information about tourist attractions and suggest destinations, itineraries, or activities based on visitors’ interests and needs.\n\nCollect tourist preferences (e.g., nature, culture).\nGenerate recommendations based on weather, traffic, and feedback.\nProvide maps and route planning.\nCollect tourist feedback to improve services.\n\n\nPreference selection interface.\nRecommended itinerary and attractions list.\nRoute planning map.\nFeedback input field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. If data can be retrieved efficiently and effectively, why data mining is needed?\nData retrieval focuses on efficiently locating data already stored in a database. In contrast, data mining applies statistical methods and artificial intelligence to extract valuable insights from existing data. This process assists businesses and researchers with decision-making, forecasting future trends, and even uncovering new knowledge. For example, in healthcare, medical data mining helps identify disease risk factors, categorize patient groups, and determine effective treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing the quality and efficiency of healthcare services. In social media, analyzing user behavior and sentiment on platforms aids businesses in understanding market trends, product reputation, and customer satisfaction, facilitating the development of effective marketing strategies.\n\n\n4. Why NoSQL systems emerged in the 2000s? Briefly contrast their features with traditional database systems.\nAfter the 2000s, the demand for emerging applications like social media and big data analytics shifted data storage requirements. Data types expanded beyond traditional structured formats to include semi-structured and unstructured formats like JSON and XML. These changes necessitated large-scale storage and rapid scalability. To accommodate high-concurrency read and write operations, NoSQL systems became suitable alternatives to traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS), which rely on row-oriented storage and strict consistency. NoSQL databases offer better flexibility for diverse data types, making them useful for large-scale social media data and real-time queries.\nKey Characteristics of NoSQL Systems:\n1. Flexible Data Model: NoSQL databases lack a fixed schema, storing semi-structured or unstructured data (e.g., JSON, XML).\n2. High Scalability: Their distributed architecture supports cost-effective horizontal scaling compared to traditional vertical scaling.\n3. Eventual Consistency: NoSQL allows temporary data inconsistencies, enhancing availability through eventual consistency.\n4. Flexible Query Mechanisms: Many NoSQL databases offer custom APIs or alternative query languages instead of SQL.\n5. Optimized for Big Data: NoSQL systems excel in handling large data volumes, such as big data storage and log analysis.\nNoSQL Systems vs. Traditional RDBMS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nNoSQL Systems\nRelational Databases (RDBMS)\n\n\n\n\nData Model\nSemi-structured or unstructured data: document-based, key-value, and graph-based models.\nStructured data stored in tables (rows and columns) with a strict schema.\n\n\nQuery Language\nCustom APIs or NoSQL query languages.\nSQL (Structured Query Language).\n\n\nScalability\nHorizontal scaling (Scale-out) fits distributed architectures.\nVertical scaling (Scale-up) depends on enhancing single-node performance.\n\n\nConsistency\nEventual consistency favors availability and scalability.\nStrong consistency (ACID) guarantees strict data integrity.\n\n\nUse Cases\nSocial media, big data applications, distributed systems.\nFinancial transactions, enterprise applications, and traditional business systems.\n\n\nPerformance Advantages\nOptimized for high-volume read and write operations.\nOptimized for structured queries and transactional processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. What are the things current database system cannot do?\n1. Automated Semantic Understanding: Databases cannot grasp the semantics of data and can only operate according to established rules.\n2. Automated Decision-Making Suggestions: Database systems do not possess advanced analytical abilities and depend on external applications for data analysis.\n\n\n6. Describe at least three tables that might be used to store information in a social-network/social media system such as Twitter or Reddit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nFields\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nUsers\nUserID, Username, Account, Citizenship, UserLevel, ProfilePicture, Membership, AverageLogintime.\nStores basic user information and authentication data.\n\n\nPosts\nPostID, UserID, Content, ContentEmotion, Tag, Language, Location, Timestamp, LikesCount, CommentsCount, AverageViewingTime.\nStores the content of each post along with its interaction data.\n\n\nInteractions\nInteractionID, UserID, PostID, InteractionType (e.g., Like, Comment, Share), InteractionContent, Timestamp.\nStores the interactions link with each post.",

This feature enables users to toggle between election types (e.g., presidential, midterm, primary) and focus only on federal elections conducted in Texas from 2016 onward. By selecting or deselecting election types, users can observe differences in turnout and registration for each election context.\nDynamic Plot Updates: When the user adjusts the filters, the scatterplot updates dynamically, enabling a comparison of turnout versus registration across different election types and timeframes. This feature provides a deeper look into how different federal elections might impact voter behavior at the county level.\nThe interactive nature of the scatterplot, combined with election-type filters, allows for a user-friendly exploration of turnout and registration patterns over time across Texas counties.",

This highlights the importance of visualizing data before relying on statistical models, as summary statistics alone can be misleading.\n\n\n3.

For public health practitioners, this bar chart highlights the sharp decline in five-year survival rates as the lung cancer stage increases, while conversely, the number of patients increases significantly. It reveals the importance of cancer screening (early detection, early treatment) and the unfortunate fact that most people wait until the last stage to be diagnosed. This chart can be used for health education. On the other hand, although the configuration of the bar chart is readable, it is difficult for laypeople without a medical background to understand the relationship between the change in the five-year survival rate (blue) and the change in the proportion of patients (orange).\n\n\n \nSource: 台灣乳癌發生率監測\n\nReview:\nThis chart illustrates the correlation between breast cancer incidence and age by birth generation in Taiwan and the United States. Different colors denote different birth generations; additionally, on the original webpage, left-clicking each age group will prompt an explanation of the corresponding data analysis results (see the second image for details). These two features assist readers in comprehending the chart’s significance. Charts for Taiwan and the United States are also presented simultaneously, enabling readers to compare the disparities between the two countries effortlessly. This chart demonstrates that in Taiwan, later generations have a higher rate of breast cancer at the same age, while this phenomenon is not observed in the United States.",

The results show a clear geographic divide: counties around major metropolitan areas such as Austin, Dallas, and Houston generally report higher incomes, while counties along the southern border and rural West Texas exhibit much lower household incomes. This highlights substantial urban–rural and regional disparities in economic well-being across the state.\nThe tables rank counties by the estimated number of people living below the poverty line. The top 10 counties (e.g., Harris, Dallas, Bexar) contain the largest absolute numbers of individuals in poverty. These are the most populous counties, which means that even with relatively high median incomes, the sheer size of the population results in large numbers of residents living in poverty. Conversely, the bottom 10 counties (e.g., Kenedy, Loving, King) report only a handful of people in poverty. However, these counties are extremely small in population, and the margins of error (MOE) are often larger than or close to the estimates themselves, making these figures less reliable.\nIn summary, the map highlights regional disparities in income levels, while the tables reveal that poverty in absolute numbers is concentrated in Texas’s largest urban counties, and very small counties show unstable estimates due to limited sample sizes.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Review\nThe podcast “The Next Industrial Revolution is Industrial AI” features a discussion between Barbara Humpton, Siemens USA CEO, and Olympia Brikis, Director of Industrial AI, on AI’s impact on manufacturing, innovation, productivity, workforce, and the industry’s future.\nThe talk starts by positioning industrial AI as succeeding earlier revolutions like electrification and automation. Unlike consumer AI, which focuses on convenience, industrial AI handles proprietary data, complex systems, and high-stakes decisions. Humpton and Brikis cite examples of AI transforming operations: in automotive, visual inspection ensures quality; Siemens’ factories use predictive maintenance and automation to free workers for cognitive tasks; Jet Zero’s aircraft employs Siemens’ generative AI and digital twin tech for efficiency and sustainability.\nBeyond technical advances, speakers highlight the human side of industrial AI. Automation boosts output without job losses, empowering workers with AI copilots for higher-level tasks. They discuss adoption challenges like access to capital and training for small and medium enterprises. Success depends on technology and workers’ openness, curiosity, and engagement with new tools.\nWhat stands out in this discussion is the balance between innovation and inclusivity. Industrial AI is not just shown as a technical upgrade but as a collaborative transformation between people and machines. The examples of night-shift workers relying on AI copilots, or training programs made for new employees, show how AI can reduce stress, improve job satisfaction, and expand access to industrial opportunities.\nIn conclusion, this talk envisions industrial AI as a major driver of progress, highlighting its role in fostering creativity, resilience, and growth alongside efficiency. Success in adopting AI globally depends on balancing innovation with workforce development, ensuring technology empowers rather than excludes. The dialogue between Humpton and Brikis shows that the “next industrial revolution” will be shaped by human adaptability as much as technological breakthroughs."

The colors are assigned randomly and do not represent different categories or presidents.\nMost prominent words (largest size = highest frequency):\n\ngovernment (purple): The dominant word, appearing most frequently in early presidential speeches.\nstates, peace, war (red/orange): Key terms reflecting concerns about national unity and international relations.\npeople, country, public (orange/red): Emphasizing democratic ideals and civic responsibility.\ngreat, every, us, may (yellow/orange): Common words used in political rhetoric.\n\nNote: Unlike the comparison word cloud, this visualization uses min_count = 10, meaning only words appearing at least 10 times are displayed. The six colors (red, pink, green, purple, orange, blue) are used purely for visual variety, not to indicate any categorical distinction.\n\n\nLexical Dispersion Plot: “American”\n\ndata_corpus_inaugural_subset &lt;- \n  corpus_subset(data_corpus_inaugural, Year &gt; 1949)\nkwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"american\") %&gt;%\n  textplot_xray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lexical dispersion plot (also called an x-ray plot) shows where the word “american” appears within each presidential inaugural speech from 1953 to 2025. Each vertical line represents one occurrence of the word, and the x-axis shows the relative position within the speech (0.00 = beginning, 1.00 = end).\nHow to read this plot:\n- Each row represents one inaugural speech (labeled by Year-President)\n- Vertical black lines indicate where “american” appears in the speech\n- More lines = more frequent use of the word\n- Spread of lines shows whether the word is used throughout or concentrated in certain parts\nKey observations:\nHigh frequency users (many vertical lines):\n- 2025-Trump: 15 occurrences, distributed across the speech\n- 2017-Trump: 12 occurrences, with concentration in the middle section\n- 2021-Biden: 10 occurrences, spread throughout the speech\n- 1997-Clinton: 8 occurrences, distributed from middle to end\n- 1985-Reagan: 6 occurrences, spread across the speech\nLow frequency users (few vertical lines):\n- 1953-Eisenhower: Only 1 occurrence\n- 1977-Carter: 3 occurrences\n- 1969-Nixon and 1973-Nixon: 2 occurrences each\nTrend over time: More recent presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden) tend to use “american” more frequently than earlier presidents (Eisenhower, Nixon, Carter), suggesting an increasing emphasis on American identity in modern political rhetoric.\n\n\nLexical Dispersion Plot: “American” vs “People” vs “Communist”\n\ntextplot_xray(\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"american\"),\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"people\"),\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"communist\")\n  \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLexical Dispersion Plot Interpretation\nThis lexical dispersion plot compares the distribution of two words — “american” and “people” — across presidential inaugural speeches from 1953 to 2025. The plot is divided into two panels (left: “american”, right: “people”). Note: We also attempted to visualize “communist”, but this word does not appear in any of the inaugural speeches, so no panel is displayed for it.\nKey observations:\n“People” (right panel) — Most frequently used (164 total occurrences):\n- Almost every president uses “people” multiple times throughout their speeches\n- High frequency users: 1985-Reagan (16), 1969-Nixon (14), 1993-Clinton (12), 1997-Clinton (11), 2013-Obama (11)\n- Low frequency users: 1961-Kennedy (1), 2001-Bush (1)\n- The word appears distributed across entire speeches, indicating it’s a fundamental term in presidential rhetoric\n“American” (left panel) — Moderate usage (87 total occurrences):\n- Usage varies significantly between presidents\n- High frequency: 2025-Trump (15), 2017-Trump (12), 2021-Biden (10), 1997-Clinton (8)\n- Low frequency: 1953-Eisenhower (1), 1961-Kennedy (0), 1973-Nixon (2)\n- Modern presidents tend to use “american” more frequently than earlier ones\nComparison insights:\n\n\n\nWord\nTotal Occurrences\nAverage per Speech\n\n\n\n\npeople\n164\n~8.6\n\n\namerican\n87\n~4.6\n\n\n\nInterpretation: “People” is a universal, high-frequency term across all presidents, while “american” shows an increasing trend over time, with recent presidents (Trump, Biden) using it more frequently than earlier ones (Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon).\n\n\nColored Lexical Dispersion Plot: “American” (Blue) vs “People” (Red) vs “Communist” (Green)\n\n## Why is the \"communist\" plot missing?\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\ng &lt;- textplot_xray(\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"american\"),\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"people\"),\n  kwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"communist\")\n)\ng + aes(color = keyword) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"green\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot is the same analysis as the previous one, but with colors added for better visual distinction: “american” in blue, “people” in red, and “communist” in green.\nWhy is the “communist” plot missing?\nThe word “communist” does not appear in any presidential inaugural speech from 1953 to 2025. Even though the code includes pattern = \"communist\" with green color assigned, there are no green lines in the plot because:\n\nInaugural speeches are ceremonial: Presidents focus on unity, hope, and positive vision rather than attacking adversaries\nDiplomatic language: Even during the Cold War, presidents avoided directly naming “communist” as it could escalate tensions\nRhetorical strategy: Instead of negative terms, presidents use positive framing like “freedom” and “democracy”\n\nComparison: “American” (Blue) vs “People” (Red)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\n“American” (Blue)\n“People” (Red)\n\n\n\n\nFrequency\nModerate, varies by president\nHigh, consistent across all\n\n\nDistribution\nOften clustered in specific sections\nSpread throughout speeches\n\n\nTrend\nIncreasing in modern speeches\nStable over time\n\n\n\nPresidents with notable usage patterns:\n- 2025-Trump: Highest “american” usage (13), moderate “people” (8)\n- 2017-Trump: High “american” (11), balanced “people” (10)\n- 1985-Reagan: Highest “people” usage (16), moderate “american” (7)\n- 1997-Clinton: High usage of both terms (9 and 11)\n- 1969-Nixon: High “people” (14), low “american” (3)\nKey insight: The absence of “communist” (green) demonstrates that presidential inaugural addresses maintain a positive, unifying tone rather than identifying external enemies, even during periods of significant geopolitical tension.\n\n\nWord Frequency Plot (Top 100 Words, 1789-1826)\n\nlibrary(quanteda.textstats)\nfeatures_dfm_inaug &lt;- textstat_frequency(dfm_inaug, n = 100)\n\n# Sort by reverse frequency order\nfeatures_dfm_inaug$feature &lt;- with(features_dfm_inaug, reorder(feature, -frequency))\n\nggplot(features_dfm_inaug, aes(x = feature, y = frequency)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter plot displays the frequency of the top 100 most common words in presidential inaugural speeches from 1789 to 1826.

Trump used “thank” 26 times compared to Obama’s 3 times. This reflects Trump’s more personal, campaign-style approach to the ceremonial speech.",

Uses reference texts with known positions (in this case: Cowen (FF) = 1, Kenny (FG) = -1)\n2. Assigns scores to each word based on how often it appears in reference texts\n3.

Government rhetoric emphasizes economic progress (“economy”, “investment”, “confidence”), while opposition rhetoric focuses on accountability and criticism (“taoiseach”, “bank”, “minister”) — patterns that reflect the dynamics of parliamentary debate during the 2010 Irish budget crisis.\n\n\nWordscores Document Positions\n\n# Get predictions\npred &lt;- predict(ws, se.fit = TRUE)\n\n# Plot estimated document positions and group by \"party\" variable\ntextplot_scale1d(pred, margin = \"documents\",\n                 groups = docvars(data_corpus_irishbudget2010, \"party\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the predicted political positions of each speaker in the 2010 Irish budget debate, grouped by their party affiliation.

This rescaling method adjusts the predicted positions to better reflect the true spread of political positions.\nWhat is LBG transformation?\nThe LBG transformation addresses a known issue with Wordscores: raw predictions tend to cluster toward the center. The LBG rescaling: - Expands the scale to show greater differentiation - Makes positions more comparable to the original reference scores - Allows predictions to exceed the original reference range (-1 to +1)\nPredicted positions with LBG rescaling:\n\n\n\nSpeaker\nParty\nLBG Score\nPosition\n\n\n\n\nCowen, Brian\nFF\n3.27\nMost pro-government\n\n\nLenihan, Brian\nFF\n1.57\nPro-government\n\n\nGormley, John\nGreen\n1.03\nGovernment (coalition)\n\n\nCuffe, Ciaran\nGreen\n0.80\nGovernment (coalition)\n\n\nRyan, Eamon\nGreen\n0.52\nGovernment (coalition)\n\n\nMorgan, Arthur\nSF\n-0.14\nMild opposition\n\n\nOCaolain, Caoimhghin\nSF\n-0.18\nMild opposition\n\n\nGilmore, Eamon\nLAB\n-0.23\nMild opposition\n\n\nBruton, Richard\nFG\n-0.42\nOpposition\n\n\nBurton, Joan\nLAB\n-0.56\nOpposition\n\n\nODonnell, Kieran\nFG\n-0.62\nOpposition\n\n\nHiggins, Michael\nLAB\n-0.81\nOpposition\n\n\nQuinn, Ruairi\nLAB\n-0.96\nOpposition\n\n\nKenny, Enda\nFG\n-2.88\nMost opposition\n\n\n\nComparison: Raw vs LBG Transformation\n\n\n\nAspect\nRaw Wordscores (Previous)\nLBG Transformation (This plot)\n\n\n\n\nScale range\n-0.14 to +0.21\n-2.88 to +3.27\n\n\nDifferentiation\nCompressed, subtle\nExpanded, clearer\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nNarrow\nWider\n\n\nInterpretation\nHarder to distinguish\nEasier to distinguish\n\n\n\nParty summary with LBG rescaling:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParty\nScore Range\nAverage\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nFF (Fianna Fáil)\n+1.57 to +3.27\n2.42\nStrongly pro-government\n\n\nGreen\n+0.52 to +1.03\n0.78\nModerate, coalition partner\n\n\nSF (Sinn Féin)\n-0.18 to -0.14\n-0.16\nMild opposition\n\n\nLAB (Labour)\n-0.96 to -0.23\n-0.64\nModerate opposition\n\n\nFG (Fine Gael)\n-2.88 to -0.42\n-1.31\nOpposition (varies widely)\n\n\n\nKey observations:\n\nGreater separation: The LBG transformation makes the gap between government (FF at +1.57 to +3.27) and opposition (FG at -2.88 to -0.42) much clearer.\nCowen’s dominance: Brian Cowen (FF) has the highest score (+3.27), far exceeding the original reference score of +1, reflecting extremely strong pro-budget rhetoric.\nKenny’s strong opposition: Enda Kenny (FG) shows the most extreme opposition position (-2.88), nearly three times the original reference score of -1, consistent with his role as opposition leader.\nGreen Party as middle ground: All Green members (0.52 to 1.03) fall between the governing FF and zero, reflecting their position as coalition partners with more moderate language.\nLabour variation: LAB members range from -0.23 (Gilmore) to -0.96 (Quinn), showing varied levels of opposition rhetoric within the party.\n\nWhen to use LBG transformation: Use LBG when you want to see the full spread of political positions, especially when raw Wordscores predictions are too compressed to interpret clearly. The LBG transformation better reveals speakers who are more extreme than the reference texts.\n\n\nWordfish Model\n\n# Estimate Wordfish model\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textmodels\")\nwf &lt;- textmodel_wordfish(dfm(tokens(data_corpus_irishbudget2010)), dir = c(6, 5))\n\n# Plot estimated word positions\ntextplot_scale1d(wf, margin = \"features\", \n                 highlighted = c(\"government\", \"global\", \"children\", \n                                 \"bank\", \"economy\", \"the\", \"citizenship\",\n                                 \"productivity\", \"deficit\"), \n                 highlighted_color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the results of a Wordfish model applied to the 2010 Irish budget speeches. Unlike Wordscores (supervised), Wordfish is an unsupervised text scaling method that estimates word and document positions simultaneously without requiring reference texts.\nWhat is Wordfish?\nWordfish is a scaling model that:\n- Estimates political positions from word frequencies alone (no reference texts needed)\n- Assumes word usage follows a Poisson distribution\n- Produces two parameters for each word: beta (position) and psi (frequency)\nHow to read this plot:\n\nX-axis (Estimated beta): Word’s political position (negative = opposition, positive = government)\n\nY-axis (Estimated psi): Word’s overall frequency (higher = more common)\n\nRed highlighted words: Selected words of interest\n\nHighlighted words analysis:\n\n\n\nWord\nBeta (Position)\nPsi (Frequency)\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nthe\n~0.0\n~4.5 (highest)\nNeutral, most frequent word\n\n\ngovernment\n~0.0\n~2.8\nCentral topic, used by all\n\n\neconomy\n~0.3\n~2.5\nSlightly government-side\n\n\nchildren\n~-0.5\n~0.5\nSlightly opposition-side\n\n\ndeficit\n~0.8\n~0.3\nGovernment-side (defending budget)\n\n\nbank\n~-1.5\n~0.0\nOpposition-side (criticizing banks)\n\n\nglobal\n~1.5\n~-2.5\nGovernment-side (global context)\n\n\ncitizenship\n~-3.5\n~-3.0\nStrong opposition (rare word)\n\n\nproductivity\n~2.5\n~-4.0\nStrong government (rare word)\n\n\n\nPattern observations:\n\nTriangular shape: Common words cluster at top-center; rare words spread to extremes\n\nFrequent neutral words (the, government) → top center\n\nRare partisan words → bottom left/right corners\n\nOpposition words (left/negative beta):\n\n“bank”, “citizenship” — criticism of financial sector, social issues\n\nAssociated with opposition rhetoric\n\nGovernment words (right/positive beta):\n\n“deficit”, “global”, “productivity” — economic justification language\n\nUsed to defend budget decisions\n\nNeutral/shared words (center):\n\n“the”, “government”, “economy” — used equally by both sides\n\n\nKey insight: Wordfish reveals that politically charged, rare words carry the most discriminating power. Common words like “the” and “government” are neutral, while specific policy terms like “productivity” (government) and “citizenship” (opposition) mark distinct political positions.\n\n\nWordfish Document Positions\n\n# Plot estimated document positions\ntextplot_scale1d(wf, \n                 margin = \"documents\",\n                 groups = docvars(data_corpus_irishbudget2010, \"party\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the estimated political positions (theta) of each speaker in the 2010 Irish budget debate using the Wordfish model.

(Consult Ch. 4, 4.1.1)\nAdding NATURAL JOIN section does not change the result because the takes table already contains the necessary attributes (course_id, semester, year, sec_id) that are also present in section. The natural join would not introduce any new information but merely duplicate existing data. As a result, the GROUP BY and HAVING conditions remain unaffected, and the query’s output stays the same.\n\n\nii Test the results using the Online SQL interpreter (https://www.dbbook.com/university-lab-dir/sqljs.html)\n\nselect course_id, semester, year, sec_id, avg (tot_cred)  \nfrom takes natural join student natural join section  \nwhere year = 2017  \ngroup by course_id, semester, year, sec_id  \nhaving count (ID) &gt;= 2;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\ncourse_id\nsemester\nyear\nsec_id\navg (tot_cred)\n\n\n\n\nCS-101\nFall\n2017\n1\n65\n\n\nCS-190\nSpring\n2017\n2\n43\n\n\nCS-347\nFall\n2017\n1\n67",
